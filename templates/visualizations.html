                    The total size of sample space of the visualization is same as the size of the dataset i.e. 6 million records
                    which means there were that many transactions made.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Transactions made are of the following 5 types :
                    <ol>
                        <li>CASH_OUT</li>
                        <li>PAYMENT</li>
                        <li>CASH_IN</li>
                        <li>TRANSFER</li>
                        <li>DEBIT</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>The frequency of each transaction type is counted from the pandas dataframe and compared against in the bar plot or
                 we can call it frequency plot.</li>
                <li> CASH_OUT was the most frequent transaction type with around approx. 2.2 million such transactions made and so were
                the PAYMENT type transactions, which are nearly 2.1 million. </li>
                <li>So, we can conclude on the finding, that CASH_OUT is the <b>Mode</b> of the dataset for field "type". </li>

            <li>Let us delve into some more number for the transaction types. This pie chart visualization delves into the percentage composition
            of the transaction types that were computed in the bar graph visualization. </li>
            <li>As it can be expected from the bar graph, CASH_OUT comprises of the highest percentage of the total transaction made
            composing of 35.16% of the total transactions and it is closely followed by PAYMENT with approx 34%. </li>
            <li>Not even 1% transactions were of the DEBIT and under 10% of those were of the TRANSFER type. </li>
            <li>This can be lead to two possibilities : </li>
            <ol>
                <li>Either the most frequent transaction like CASH_OUT and PAYMENT will have much higher instances of fraudulent transaction.</li>
                <li> Or, the least frequent ones, like TRANSFER and DEBIT, have been having greater fraudulent instances and hence, the users might have stopped making these type of transactions.</li>

            <li>This is a Treemap visualization that compares the mean and median of the field 'amount' which is the
            transaction amount across all 6 million records in the dataset. </li>
            <li> It is a generic concept in terms of statistical and data analysis that mean and median are usually the same in a
            dataset and if not the same, then at least similar. </li>
            <li> However, this also depends upon the nature of the dataset we are working. Datasets that are highly heterogeneous, will have a
            large entropy i.e. degree of randomness that could cause variations in the mean and median. </li>
            <li> In addition to that, a greater number of extremes in the values also contributes to great variations in the mean and median.
            Afterall, mean is the average, sum of all instances divided by the no. of instances, whereas median is the middle most instance.</li>
            <li> As this dataset is highly heterogeneous i.e. having high entropy level and lot of extreme values, the mean and median vary greatly.
                The Treemap takes the mean and median as two nodes and graphically represent them with respect to the <b><i>areas under the curve</i> </b>
            that they represent. </li>
            <li> As we can see, the mean node covers a much greater area, in an epistemic sense, more than twice than that of the median node. So, it
            corroborates with the heterogeneity, high entropy and the extreme ended values of the dataset. </li>
            <li> To be more specific in terms of numbers, the mean amount was approx. $179862 whereas the median was approx. $74782. So, the
            mean is almost 2.4 times then median and hence, it fits very well with the treemap visualization in terms of the area under the curve
            for each node. </li>

            <li>This visualization is a Box and Whisker plot between old and new mean balances at two different locations - Origin and Destination</li>
            <li>From the given dataset, when an amount is transacted, they changes are reflected in the old and new balance after that transaction, like it
            happens anywhere at real-time. These post-transactional changes are recorded at the Origin and the Destination. </li>
            <li> In order to process the post-transaction balance changes more feasibly, the mean balances are computed for four instances and polotted
            against each in this Box and Whisker plot. So, it is like "old balance at Origin " v/s "new balance at Origin" and same for "old balance at destination"
            v/s "new balance at destination". </li>
            <li> A key consideration while using the Box and Whisker visualization was that it takes into account the median value while plotting
            a data point on the graphical plane. And, we are computing the mean values for each balance record. So, in this way, we take into both
            the mean and median of each balance record at the same time. </li>
            <li> Analyzing the graph, we can infer that, on an average, when transactions took place at origin, the change was very less between the old
            and the new balances. Both pre and post transaction balances at the origin are about 800K at a similar level.</li>
            <li> But at the destination, the change in mean balance is stark. We can see, the post-transaction mean balance is greater than the
            pre-transaction mean balance. This could possibly mean that the transactions at the destination, in a generic sense, were mostly of
            the type CASH_IN. Hence, the increase in the mean new balance </li>

                In this visualization of a line plot, two correlation metrics have computed, evaluated and compared across three
                sets of feature pairs. Let us delve in to the details of what correlation metrics are and the feature pair that are
                evaluated. The correlation metrics used are :
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Cosine Similarity : </b> The Cosine Similarity is a correlation metric that measure how similar two documents can be.
                        In this scenario, the documents are our two paired feature sets and we try to determine how similar they are. It is computed
                        as the dot product between the documents or feature sets, like in the current scenario.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>Kullback-Liebler Divergence : </b> The Kullback-Liebler (KL) Divergence, sometimes also called as Relative Entropy,
quantifies how much one probability distribution differs from another. In this scenario, these distributions are our feature sets and we determine
                    the divergent they are from one another.</li>
                </ol>
                The feature sets are being evaluated are :
                <ol>
                    <li> <b> isFraud v/s isFlaggedFraud : </b> how similar or divergent are these features of instances that are actually fraudulent v/s they are flagged as fraudulent by the current algorithm. </li>
                    <li> <b> oldBalanceOrg v/s newBalanceOrg : </b> how similar or divergent are the balances before and after transactions at the origin. </li>
                    <li> <b> oldBalanceDest v/s newBalanceDest : </b> how similar or divergent are the balances before and after transactions at the destination. </li>
                </ol>

            </li>

            <li>The rationale behind using these correlation metrics is to analyze whether similarity and divergence holds true the hypotheses
            that whether both of them follow any inverse behavorial pattern or not. Let us see how this works out. </li>
            <li> In the cosine similarity, line plot, we can see the feature set of [isFraud, isFlaggedFraud] has higher cosine similarity
            than [oldBalanceOrg,newBalanceOrg].</li>
            <li>But it is the inverse case in the KL-Divergence. [oldBalanceOrg,newBalanceOrg] has much higher KL-Divergence than of [isFraud, isFlaggedFraud].
            In addition to that, the percentage increment/decrement trend in both the correlation metrics also looks quite similar. </li>
            <li>This also holds true for the [oldBalanceDest,newBalanceDest]. While, the cosine similarity shows an incremental trend from
            [oldBalanceOrg,newBalanceOrg], for KL-Divergence, shows a decremental trend. </li>
            <li> So, in a way cosine similarity and KL-Divergence do exhibit some kind of an inverse behavorial pattern. The hypotheses can be further
            solidified if the dataset could have more robust and contained higher True Positive samples for fraudulent transaction instances. </li>
